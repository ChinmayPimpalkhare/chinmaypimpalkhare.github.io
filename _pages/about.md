Hi! This is Chinmay Pimpalkhare. I graduated from IIT Bombay with a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering with Honors and a Minor in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I would be joining American Express as a Management Trainee in the Credit Fraud and Risk department. My passion lies in machine learning, optimization and finance, particularly in Reinforcement Learning & Decision Making, Online Learning, Stochastic Modeling and Optimization. 

During my undergraduate days, I have worked with Prof. Debasish Chatterjee on synthesising continuous feedbacks for ensuring robust strong invariance of control systems using CSIP (convex semi-infinite programming). I have also worked with Prof. Dnyanesh Pawaskar, where I used deep learning for crack detection on synthetic thermogram datasets generated through an in-house finite element simulation pipeline. I have been a part of the Student Satellite Program, where I worked in the Mechanical and the Guidance, Navigation and Controls subsystems and also got the valuable experience of leading projects right from scratch in my senior year. I have also served as a teaching assistant for the courses PH108: Basics of Electricity and Magnetism and ME312: Industrial Engineering and Operations Research I


[subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
